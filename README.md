## ðŸš€ About This Project
This expense tracker is a great tool for you to keep track of your Income, Expenses and Balance.

To enter your income, click on the green plus button under the "Income" display and enter proper information for each form input. Once you're done entering your information, click the add button below the form. A transaction should be added to the "Transactions" section. You can repeat this process as well for entering your expenses, the only difference is to click the red plus button under the "Expense" display to add your expenses.

The Balance is automatically updated when you enter either an income transaction or an expense transaction.

If you made a mistake in the transaction you entered, just click the delete button on the far right of the transaction and re-enter the correct information in the form.
